SystemsManagement is a Unity Singleton implementation. 

Before using this or any other singleton implementation please consider whether it is right for your project. Singletons have a lot of drawbacks. 

# How It Works/Why Use This Implementation
A prefab contains all your game systems. This prefab persists through scenes and is loaded in only when needed (lazy loading).

Using a prefab instead of having a separate initialization scene (like many other singleton implementations) means we don't have to run an init scene first - we can start anywhere we want.

We also don't have to open the init scene in editor to edit the singletons.

# How To Use
## 1. Install Package
In Unity 
1. Go to the Package Manager 
2. Click the little plus in the top left and "Add Package From git URL ..."
3. Paste `https://github.com/JohnnyHowe/com.jonathonoh.unity.systemsmanagement.git` and click add.

## 2. Create Systems prefab
This prefab must be in the root of a resources folder and called "Systems". This is where you'll put all of your system components.\
Add the `SystemsInitializer` component to the root "Systems" GameObject.

I'd recommend putting them on child objects to keep it tidy. 
So the hierarchy might look like this:
```
Systems
 |- SystemA
 |- SystemB
 |- SystemC
 |- SystemD
```

## 3. Create a System
Just like any other Singleton

```csharp
public class ThingIWantToAccessEverywhere: GameSystem<ThingIWantToAccessEverywhere>
{
    public void DoAThing()
    {
        ...
    }
}
```

## 4. Done
Now you can call it anywhere

```csharp
ThingIWantToAccessEverywhere.Instance.DoAThing();
```
## Using With Interfaces
Due to how I've written the code, this should be a slower. It's up to you to pick your poison.
```csharp
public interface HandyInterface
{
    public void DoAThing();
}
```
```csharp
public class ThingIWantToAccessEverywhere: GameSystem<ThingIWantToAccessEverywhere>, HandyInterface
{
    public void DoAThing()
    {
        ...
    }
}
```
And access it with
```csharp
GameSystem<HandyInterface>.Instance.DoAThing();
```
